<h1>Welcome to the ToroDB Stampede documentation</h1>

This documentation has different chapters that explain various topics at different levels of abstraction. __You can read it from beginning to end, or you can jump to the preferred section anytime__.

To make it easier for you, here you have a few tips:

* You have no idea what ToroDB Stampede does or why do you need it? we understand and that's the reason why we prepared the [about](about.md) section, just for you :-)
* You want to make an easy and quick test? [quickstart](quickstart.md) will be your starting point.
* You know how to launch ToroDB Stampede and now you want to make a custom configuration?, then start reading [previous requirements](installation/previous-requirements.md) section and following chapters, and of course, don't forget the [appendix](appendix.md) with all the available options.
* Maybe you want to have a deeper understanding about how ToroDB Stampede maps NoSQL data into relational data, then your read will be the [how to use](how-to-use.md) section.
